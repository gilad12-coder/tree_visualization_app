**http://localhost:5001**

> **Note:** The application runs on port 5001. Make sure this port is not in use by another application.

### Quick Start for Windows Users (After Git Clone)

If you've just cloned the repository on Windows and want to get started quickly:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell** in the project directory
2. **Run the automated build script:**
   ```cmd
   build.bat
   ```
   This will install all dependencies and build the executable automatically.

3. **Or run in development mode:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   npm run build
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:5001`

### Running as a Standalone Application

For end users, the application can be run as a standalone executable:

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice
3. **Windows:** Double-click `TreeVisualizationApp.exe`
4. **macOS:** Double-click `TreeVisualizationApp.app` (or drag to Applications folder)

## 🛠️ Building Standalone Executables

Build platform-specific executables for Windows and macOS with all internationalization features included.

### Prerequisites for Building

- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Node.js 14+ with npm
- PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`

**Important**: PyInstaller creates platform-specific executables. Build on Windows for `.exe` and on macOS for Mac executables.

### Quick Build (Automated)

Use the automated build script that handles everything:

**Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
```cmd
build.bat
```

Or double-click `build.bat` in Windows Explorer.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

The script will automatically:
1. Install all Python dependencies (including PyInstaller)
2. Install all Node.js dependencies
3. Build the React frontend with all translations
4. Create the standalone executable
5. (macOS only) Create .app bundle for easy distribution

### Manual Build Steps

If you prefer to build manually:

1. **Install Dependencies**

   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build React Frontend** (CRITICAL - includes all translations)

   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   npm run build
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Build the Executable**

   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   pyinstaller app.spec
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller app.spec
   ```

4. **Create macOS App Bundle (macOS only)**
   ```bash
   python3 create_app_bundle.py
   ```

5. **Locate the Executable**

   **Windows:**
   ```
   dist\TreeVisualizationApp.exe
   ```
   Double-click the `.exe` file to run, or run from command line:
   ```cmd
   dist\TreeVisualizationApp.exe
   ```

   **macOS:**
   ```
   dist/TreeVisualizationApp.app
   ```
   Double-click the `.app` bundle to run, or use:
   ```bash
   open dist/TreeVisualizationApp.app
   ```

   **Linux:**
   ```
   dist/TreeVisualizationApp
   ```
   Run with:
   ```bash
   ./dist/TreeVisualizationApp
   ```

### What's Included

The standalone executable includes:
- ✅ Complete React frontend with all components
- ✅ Flask backend with all routes
- ✅ English & Hebrew translations (40+ keys)
- ✅ Full RTL layout support
- ✅ Language-aware UI (toast positioning, arrow directions)
- ✅ Automatic browser launch
- ✅ All dependencies (no installation required to run)

### Distribution

**Windows:**
- Distribute the single `TreeVisualizationApp.exe` file
- Users can run it directly - no installation needed
- File size: ~150-200 MB

**macOS:**
- Distribute the `TreeVisualizationApp.app` bundle
- Users can drag it to Applications folder
- File size: ~100-150 MB

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd dist
Compress-Archive -Path TreeVisualizationApp.exe -DestinationPath TreeVisualizationApp-v1.0-windows.zip
```

**Windows (Command Prompt with 7-Zip or WinRAR):**
```cmd
cd dist
"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a TreeVisualizationApp-v1.0-windows.zip TreeVisualizationApp.exe
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd dist
zip -r TreeVisualizationApp-v1.0-macos.zip TreeVisualizationApp.app
```

**Note**: The executable is self-contained with all dependencies included. No Python or Node.js installation required on the target machine.

### Troubleshooting

**Build fails with missing build/ directory**
- Solution: Run `npm run build` first before building the executable

**Executable won't start (Windows)**
- Solution: Check that all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed
- Try running from Command Prompt to see error messages
- Ensure Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking the executable

**Executable won't start (macOS)**
- Solution: Right-click the `.app` and select "Open" if you get a security warning
- Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Allow the app

**Port 5001 already in use**
- Solution: Close any other applications using port 5001, or modify `main.py` to use a different port

**Browser doesn't open automatically**
- Solution: Manually navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser

**Hebrew text not displaying**
- Solution: Rubik font loads from Google Fonts - check internet connection
- Fonts are also bundled in the executable, so this should work offline

**Database errors**
- Solution: Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where you're creating/accessing the database
- On Windows, try running as Administrator if permission issues persist
